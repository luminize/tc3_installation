# Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019

This one is simple. Just run the installer installing the basic set op options.
I choose not to use the "Workload" option during install because I didn't know what it meant.

Installing MS Visual Studio will enable you to write PLC programs from within MS Visual Studio. And at the same time have ease of using GIT for your software versioning.

When the installation is finished, continue.
